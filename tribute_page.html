      <p>Bhupen Hazarika ([bʱupɛn ɦazɔɹika]) (8 September 1926 – 5 November 2011) was an Indian playback singer, lyricist, musician, singer, poet and filmmaker from Assam, widely known as Sudhakantha. His songs, written and sung mainly in the Assamese language by himself, are marked by humanity and universal brotherhood and have been translated and sung in many languages, most notably in Bengali and Hindi. His songs, based on the themes of communal amity, universal justice and empathy, have become popular among the people of Assam, besides West Bengal and Bangladesh. He is also acknowledged to have introduced the culture and folk music of Assam and Northeast India to Hindi cinema at the national level. He received the National Film Award for Best Music Direction in 1975. Recipient of Sangeet Natak Akademi Award (1987), Padmashri (1977), and Padmabhushan (2001),[2] Hazarika was awarded with Dada Saheb Phalke Award (1992), Highest award of India for cinema, by the Government of India, and Sangeet Natak Akademi Fellowship (2008), the highest award of the Sangeet Natak Akademi, India's The National Academy for Music, Dance and Drama.<br> <br> He was posthumously awarded the Padma Vibhushan, India's second-highest civilian award, in 2012.[3] Hazarika also held the position of the Chairman of the Sangeet Natak Akademi from December 1998 to December 2003.[4] He was posthumously awarded the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award, in 2019.[5][6] </p>
      
      <p id="tribute-info">Hazarika studied at Sonaram High School at Guwahati, Dhubri Government High School[7] and matriculated from Tezpur High School in 1940. He completed his Intermediate Arts from Cotton College in 1942, and his BA (1944) and MA (1946) in Political Science from Banaras Hindu University. For a brief period he worked at All India Radio, Guwahati when he won a scholarship from Columbia University and set sail for New York in 1949. There he earned a PhD (1952) on his thesis "Proposals for Preparing India's Basic Education to use Audio-Visual Techniques in Adult Education".<br> <br> In New York, Bhupen Hazarika befriended Paul Robeson, a prominent civil rights activist, who influenced him in[9] his song Bistirno parore which is based on the imagery and theme of Robeson's Ol' Man River. This song is translated in various Indian languages, including Bengali and Hindi and sung by the artist himself, and is still popular. Being inspired from some other foreign ones, he also composed several other songs in Indian languages. He was exposed to the Spiritual, and the multi-lingual version of We are in the Same Boat Brother[10] became a regular feature in his stage performance. At Columbia University, he met Priyamvada Patel, whom he married in 1950. Tez Hazarika, their only child, was born in 1952,[11] and he returned to India in 1953. </p>
